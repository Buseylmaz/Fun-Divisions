# **Fun Divisions**
I developed a game based on division operations for children aged 6-7. I created this project to improve myself. The game is designed to help children learn division in a fun and educational way.

## **How To Play**
First, the player starts the game by pressing the "Start" button. Upon entering the game, they are greeted by an alpha screen. After this screen passes, the buttons load one by one, and questions appear at the top. If the player clicks the wrong button, they lose a life. If they click the correct button, they earn points based on the difficulty of the question. Additionally, images of toys appear in the squares they click correctly.
